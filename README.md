All programs require matplotlib and numpy to run.

To run a programe, use the command
$ python <filename.py>


The different programs are:
binary_classifier_average_perceptron.py - Binary Classifier with averaged perceptron  
binary_classifier_pa.py                 - Binary Classifier with Passive Aggressive algorithm
multi_class_average.py                  - Multi Class averaged perceptron
multi_class_classifier.py               - Multi Class plain perceptron
binary_classifier_incr.py               - Binary Classifier perceptron increasing training exacmples in batches of 1000
binary_classifier_perceptron.py         - Binary classifier with plain perceptron
multi_class_classifier_incr.py          - Multi Class Classifier increasing training exacmples in batches of 1000
multi_class_pa.py                       - Multi Class Classifier with Passive Aggressive algorithm
binary_classifier_pa_incr.py            - Binary Classifier with passive aggressive algorithm increasing training examples in batches of 1000

Each program outputs a graph for learning curve and accuracy, as well as the list that is plotted in the graph
